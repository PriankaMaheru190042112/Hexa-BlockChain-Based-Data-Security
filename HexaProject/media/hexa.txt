1.Introduction
HEXA is a blockchain-based project that provides solutions to protect businesses from the threats
associated with third-party data breaches and security vulnerabilities. As most businesses rely on external
service providers and vendors, this dependency creates significant security challenges making data
protection a top priority. Here, Project HEXA uses the transparency, immutability, and decentralized nature of
blockchain technology to establish a robust and secure blockchain framework for business data
safeguarding. By integrating homomorphic encryption and asymmetric cryptography in a multilayer
architecture, HEXA guarantees sensitive information remains confidential and tamper-proof throughout its
operations. Integration of Homomorphic encryption enables computation on encrypted data while
maintaining its confidentiality, whereas, utilization of Asymmetric cryptography, enables secured
communication ensuring confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of data using a pair of
related keys. However, HEXA concentrates on reducing risks from third-party service providers and suppliers,
helping fortify businesses against security breaches, privacy violations, and unauthorized access to critical
information.

To ensure the utmost privacy and security for technical/numeric data, we employ an innovative
approach utilizing homomorphic encryption and the Hyperledger Fabric. Upon encryption using
homomorphic encryption techniques, the data will be stored securely within the Hyperledger Fabric.
When a party requires access to this encrypted data for analytical purposes, they are granted
permission by the data owner. The remarkable aspect of this approach is that the party can perform
analytical operations on the encrypted data without the need for decryption. Homomorphic
encryption guarantees 100% effectiveness of analytical operations, preserving the high level of
privacy and security desired by the data owner.
B. Strategic Data (Business Logic, Logistics Data, Marketing Requirements)
Strategic data is encrypted using asymmetric encryption and stored in IPFS. A unique cryptographic
hash is generated for each data file and stored in Hyperledger Fabric. When a second party needs
access to the data, they provide the uploader with the cryptographic hash. The uploader uses the
hash to query the platform and redirect the second party to the IPFS client. The second party
decrypts the file using their private key and proceeds with the necessary operations. The uploader
can track all actions performed by the second party.
The data remains confidential and controlled access is ensured. This approach offers several
benefits, including:
● Maximum security: The data is encrypted at all times and stored in a decentralized file
system.
● Immutability: The cryptographic hash ensures that the data cannot be tampered with.
● Data validity: The cryptographic hash allows the second party to verify the authenticity of the
data.
● Controlled access: The uploader can track all actions performed by the second party.
3.3.2 Process Overview

encrypted data using IPFS.
Hyperledger Fabric Integration: Store the generated CID in the Hyperledger Fabric. Then provide a copy of the
CID to the data uploader.
5
Requesting Data: When a second party needs access to the strategic data, they request the corresponding
CID frCID from the uploader.
Query Creation and Redirection: The second party creates a query within the platform using the
cryptographic hash (CID). It’ll redirect the second party to the IPFS client for further data processing.
Tracking and Data Validity: Enable the uploader to track all movements and actions of the second party. The
CID helps the second party verify data validity and ensure data integrity.
Decryption and Operations: Decrypt the data file using the second party's private key. Then they’ll perform
further operations on the decrypted data.
Data Management: Upon completion of operations, allow the uploader to remove or re-encrypt the data
based on their preference. It’ll ensure that the second party cannot access the data file without explicit
permission from the uploader.

Technical Architecture
Our data sharing platform focuses on facilitating the secure exchange of two fundamental types of data
prevalent in the business sector.
6.1. Technical Data
Hexa Software uses a dedicated flowchart to handle and safeguard technical data. This flowchart
incorporates the utilization of specific encryption mechanisms, such as homomorphic encryption, and
storage protocols, such as the Hyperledger fabric. By following this flowchart, Hexa Software ensures the
9
confidentiality, integrity, and seamless analysis of technical data, empowering organizations to leverage
insights without compromising data privacy or security.The process of data handling and analysis in Hexa
Software involves the following steps:
Data Upload: Stakeholder companies provide data in various formats to Hexa Software. This data contains
information relevant to the analysis and predictions.
Encryption with Public Key: Hexa Software employs Homomorphic Encryption techniques to protect the
confidentiality of the data. The data is encrypted using a public key, ensuring that only authorized parties
with the corresponding private key can access and decrypt the data.
Homomorphic Computation: The encrypted data undergoes computation using a series of Homomorphic
Computation formulas. This computation is performed in two steps:
Encrypted Communication: The data is processed through Homomorphic Computation formulas, preserving
the privacy of the information while allowing for meaningful computations to be performed on the encrypted
data.
Differential Privacy: In this step, additional noise is introduced into the data to provide an added layer of
privacy protection. The noise makes the data appear flawed or distorted, making it difficult for malicious
actors or unauthorized individuals to infer sensitive information from the encrypted data.
Encrypted Data Transmission: Once the data is prepared through Homomorphic Computation and
differential privacy techniques, it is ready for analysis and predictions. The encrypted data is securely
transmitted to Analytics, Marketing, and AI companies for further processing.
Analytics and Predictions: The receiving companies, equipped with the necessary tools and capabilities,
perform analytics and predictions on the encrypted data. The Homomorphic Encryption ensures that the
computations and analysis can be conducted without decrypting the data, maintaining the confidentiality of
the information.
Result Distribution: After the analytics and predictions are completed, the resulting outcomes are generated
in an encrypted format. These encrypted results are then sent back to the respective Stakeholder
companies.
Usage by Stakeholder Companies: Upon receiving the encrypted results, the Stakeholder companies can
utilize the data for their intended purposes. They can decrypt the results using their private keys to gain
access to the analyzed information while ensuring the security and integrity of the overall process.
By following this process, Hexa Software combines Homomorphic Encryption, encrypted communication,
and differential privacy techniques to safeguard sensitive data, enable secure analytics and predictions, and
maintain the privacy of the stakeholders' information throughout the entire data handling process.

6.2. Strategic Data
Strategic data represents descriptive information vital for business operations, encompassing elements
such as business logic, logistics data, and marketing requirements. To address the unique characteristics
and security requirements of strategic data, our platform leverages the dedicated flowchart of the strategic
data channel. Within the presentation layer, users will engage with the system's interface to effortlessly
upload and retrieve data. Moving to the business logic layer, our system employs a diversified approach to
ensure optimal security, immutability, and data validity. To achieve this, we apply asymmetric encryption,
11
utilizing the robust RSA algorithm, to encrypt data files. These encrypted files are then securely stored using
IPFS, a decentralized file system specifically chosen for its ability to handle large-scale strategic data, such
as business logic and logistics files. As a result, IPFS generates a unique Content Identifier (CID), a
cryptographic hash for each data file. We securely store this CID in the Hyperledger Fabric and share a copy
with the data uploader.
When a second party requires access to the data for subsequent operations, the uploader provides them
with the corresponding CID. The second party then creates a query within our platform, utilizing this
cryptographic hash, which directs them to the IPFS client for further data processing. Throughout this
process, the uploader retains the ability to monitor and track all movements and actions undertaken by the
second party. The CID serves as a means for the second party to verify data validity and ensure data
integrity. Upon decryption using their private key, the second party can proceed with additional operations on
the data. Following the completion of these operations, the uploader may choose to remove the data or
re-encrypt it based on their individual preferences. It is important to note that the second party is unable to
access the data file of the uploader without explicit permission.
In the data layer, all user activities are securely stored and recorded. This multi-layer architecture
encompasses the comprehensive process flow of our system, maintaining utmost security and ensuring
seamless data management throughout.
